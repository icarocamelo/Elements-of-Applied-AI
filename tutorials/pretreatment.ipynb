You should refer to the \"Data\" chapter of the \"Introduction to Data Mining\" book (slides are available at https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/index.php) to understand some of the concepts introduced in this tutorial. The notebook can be downloaded from http://www.cse.msu.edu/~ptan/dmbook/tutorials/tutorial4/tutorial4.ipynb.\n",

    "\n",
    "Poor data quality can have an adverse effect on data mining. Among the common data quality issues include noise, outliers, missing values, and duplicate data. This section presents examples of Python code to alleviate some of these data quality problems. We begin with an example dataset from the UCI machine learning repository containing information about breast cancer patients. We will first download the dataset using Pandas read_csv() function and display its first 5 data points.\n",
